# TabToWindow
Autohotkey script to move the current tab in firefox to a new window. The hotkey is set to `ctrl` + `alt` + `N` but can 
of course be changed.

This script uses firefox's context menu. You need to use the correct version for your installed language.

## What is the _%cal%_ variable?
The _%cal%_ variable sets the time in milliseconds the script puts between each command. The amount needed is determined 
by the pc's perfomance and probably has to be adjusted.
